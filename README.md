Task: create a simple writing system to write down agricultural activities & events quickly and easily, assuming a particular setup.

Requirements:
- Usable in single color on any paper
- Compact
- Easy to write by hand
- Easy to see long-term patterns

The writing system describes agriculturally significant events related to experimental 3 L glass jars filled to 1/3 with earth, each with a 0.5 L PET watering bottle in the middle. The bottle has a hole in the bottom and leaks water drop by drop over the course of many days. The jars are relatively independent experiments. The writing system developed allows to draw or visualize crude graphs of all three major plant factors and their consequences on a time strip.

Each day for every jar is represented by a compound symbol.
Each symbol has a vertical bar, and on each bar there are 5 implied height points corresponding to different levels of indicated value:
1. At the foot
2. Between the foot and middle
3. At middle point
4. Above middle point
5. At the top of the bar

These are 5 easily recognizable possible states for each of: water level, temperature and light level.
The 6th rare highest state is represented by a double mark in 5th state.

The following marks are added to the vertical bar at heights corresponding to their values, 1-6:

/ is water level in the water bottle:

- / &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0-100 mL
- // &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100-200 mL
- /// &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200-300 mL
- //// &nbsp;&nbsp;300-400 mL
- ///// &nbsp;400-500 mL
- ////// 500+ mL

Differences between water levels allow to visualize water leaking rate, which affects current soil dampness.


\ is temperature in degrees Celsius:

- \\ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negative to 0
- \\\ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0-8
- \\\\\ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8-16
- \\\\\\\ &nbsp;&nbsp;16-24
- \\\\\\\\\ &nbsp;24-32
- \\\\\\\\\\\ 32+

I assumed differences between temperatures below water freezing point don't matter to plants too much.


o is light level determined by sight:

- o &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No light
- oo &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low artificial light for 24 hours
- ooo &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reasonably bright artificial light for 24 hours
- oooo &nbsp;&nbsp;Low natural light
- ooooo &nbsp;Bright natural light OR low natural light + 24h bright artificial light
- oooooo Bright natural light + 24h bright artificial light


Argricultural events are:

- v planting; species' initials are written next to the rune
- Λ germination
- ∇ flowering
- Δ fruit
- Π illness
- □ death
- ▯ sterilization

This gives over 2000 compound symbols describing various possible observations in a given jar on a given day.
